## About Me:  
Welcome! I am a senior at the George Washington University studying Mechanical & Electrical Engineering, with a concentration in robotics. I am an Undergraduate Research Fellow working in the [Smart Systems Laboratory](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~amwick/), and upon graduation will be joining Raytheon as a Cyber Security Engineer II.

## Research
My research is at the intersection of collaborative/cooperative robotics and machine learning. Specifically, I develop reinforcement learning algorithms that enable robots to "learn" to interact with one another, with the goal of improving the safety and efficiency of their interactions. I am currently working with an asyncronous reinforcement learning architecture (akin to A3C). Hopefully I'll be posting more info here soon!

## Projects

### Battle Bot
My favorite project so far has been to [develop a battle bot](https://scottbarnesg.github.io/battle_bot/) for my Engineering System Design course. We designed a multi-weaponed robot that could drive even after being flipped over entirely from scratch. As the "software guy" in the group, I was tasked with developing the software for our motor control and RF communication systems, as well as repurposing a video-game controller as the remote control's input device. I primarily developed software for embedded systems in C++, but also worked in Python (for interfacing with the video-game controller). All software was deployed on an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. For more information, check out our [project website](https://scottbarnesg.github.io/battle_bot/), which walks through the entire design, test, and deployment process we used.
